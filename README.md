## Summary
In this assignment you can implement anything you want as long as it is technical and related to Computer Graphics. Here are some example final projects that you can chose to implment or just use as a refernce for scope and complexity we are expecting:
* Extend the SVG renderer from Assigment 1, so it can render any SVG from the web
* Implement all of the extra credits for Assigment 2 (if you haven't done so already) and create a cool 3D model
* Complete the Animation part of Assignment 2
* Extend Assignment 3 to render more advanced shadows and materials


Feel free to come up with you own project ideas and discuss them with the staff on Piazza or during office hours. In order to make sure that your project is related to the class and has the right scope we ask you to submit a short project proposal, which is worth 5% of your Final Project grade.

The proposal has to be at most 2 pages long. It is fine if the proposal is a little longer than two pages due the image or some other asset taking up space, but please, try to keep it within 2 pages!
The proposal will have the following sections:
* SuNET ID's of the people working on the project
* Brief one sentence summary of your project
* More detailed description of exactly what you want to ahieve
* Example images/videos or other assets that you want to produce
* Optional: dependecies. If your project is not based on previous class assignments, list the code base or other dependencies you plan on using.
